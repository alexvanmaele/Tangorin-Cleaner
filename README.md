Tangorin-Cleaner is a Userscript meant to transform Tangorin.com into a more minimalistic site.

It clears a lot of visual clutter and accentuates the search functionality of the site.

--------------

1. Open the script
2. Copy and paste the code into your Userscript client (e.g. Greasemonkey)
3. Save it

Note: you're not required to fill in a name for the script, as it will be auto-generated by your client.
